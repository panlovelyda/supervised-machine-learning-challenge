# The dataset is a collection of numerical and categorical data. The machine learning algorithms random forest and logistic regression are used for various disciplines for classification and regression purposes.
# Logistic Regression model score:  0.9920037144036319
# Random Forest Classifier score:  0.9969304581097813
# Random Forest Classifier model is better than Logistic Regression model because the score is higher. This is quite suprised as I used to predit that the Logistic Regression model should have a better score. The reasion could be the nature of the dataset.
